RFC 9309

## Challenge Description
Sorry. You know every CTF has to have it. 🤷

we have an instance to start in this challenge which opened a webpage, the content shown was a transcript from the Robots Exclusion Protocol (RFC 9309).This covers if and how crawlers are supposed to handle the website. So the best guess was to see if /robots.txt holds the flag but that wasnt the case.

We were able to reach robots.txt it didnt have the flag but we saw a **Disallow /flag.txt** entry.

We visited the endpoint directly i.e /flag.txt and got the flag:
flag{aec1142c199aa5d8ad0f3ae3fa82e13c}
